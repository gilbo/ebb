This project is a port of the Liszt DSL, which was originally embedded in Scala, to the Lua/Terra system, with the following (planned) extensions:
 - implicit method support (both sparse matrix encoding and an interface to external solver libraries)
 - particles
 - mesh data will be stored on a generic OP2-like graph structure that will allow us to represent fields and sparse matrices with the same data structure.

compiler/ - liszt code parsing, semantic checking and code gen
examples/ - example liszt programs, and applications written in terra that use the liszt runtime
include/ - interface for liszt application programmers
runtime/ - C++ liszt runtime and terra runtime interface
spec/ - contains example programs written in the Scala version of Liszt, paired with their Liszt-in-Terra equivalents.
